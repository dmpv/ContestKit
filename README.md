# ContestKit
Demo project highlighting the architecture of apps I build

### RDXKit

RDXKit is used for the model. It is an implementation of Redux in swift.

Instead of implementing Redux as is, it has some valueble additions:
- Reducers come inside actions
- Support for moduls

### Components 

UI is built using components (shallow views with state)

The app demonstrates the approach for
— managing app state
— module segregation
— handling lists
— handling user actions
— managing side-effects
